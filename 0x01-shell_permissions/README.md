Created a directed for my 0x01-shell_permissions project.

The 0-iam_betty script switches the current user to the user betty.

The 1-who_am_i script prints the effective username of the current user. 

The 2-groups script prints all the groups the current user is part of.

The 3-new_owner changes the owner of the hello file to betty.

The 4-empty creates an empty file called hello.

The 5-execute change the group permissions  for the hello file to include execution.

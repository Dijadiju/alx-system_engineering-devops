Created a directed for my 0x01-shell_permissions project.

The 0-iam_betty script switches the current user to the user betty.

The 1-who_am_i script prints the effective username of the current user. 

The 2-groups script prints all the groups the current user is part of.

The 3-new_owner changes the owner of the hello file to betty.

The 4-empty creates an empty file called hello.

The 5-execute script changes the file owner  permissions  for the hello file to include execution.

The 6-multiple_permissions script adds execute permission to the owner and the group owner, and read permission to other users, to the file hello.

The 7-everybody script adds execution permission to the owner, the group owner and the other users, to the file hello.

The 8-James_Bond script sets the hello file to no permissions for the user and group owners and all permissions for othetr users.
